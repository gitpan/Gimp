Revision history for Perl extension Gimp.

0.01  Fri Feb  6 17:51:56 CET 1998
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.18

0.02  Sat Feb  7 04:18:17 CET 1998
	- first working version

0.03  Sat Feb  7 06:15:09 CET 1998
	- even more usable. although only pdb calls are implemented,
	  most gimp functions are available. dealing with tiles
	  directly in perl is probbaly too slow anyway.
	- the example plugin does slightly more now.

0.04  Sat Feb  7 21:43:56 CET 1998
	- gimp_channel_set_color uses a d_color argument, like everybody else
	- libgimp functions will be used instead of pdb calls
	  wherever possible. libgimp functions using different calling
	  conventions than equivalent pdb functions (gimp_layer_copy, etc..)
	  are NOT exported.

0.05  Sat Feb  7 23:31:08 CET 1998
	- added set_trace and trace capabilities. helps to track down bugs in
	  pdb calls

0.06  Wed Feb 11 02:42:24 CET 1998
	- the first user sent an example script ;)
	- PARAM_STRING's are now correctly displayed in traces
	- start of Gimp::Util, not very convincing
	- pseudo-oo interface, see Gimp::OO

0.07  Thu Feb 12 06:51:56 CET 1998
	- some bugfixes, and the addition of Gimp::Net and an accompanying
	  server. See example-net.pl for a demo.
