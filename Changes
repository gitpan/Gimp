Revision history for Gimp-Perl extension.

0.92  Sat May 23 23:46:33 CEST 1998
	- preliminary GDrawable support (NOT Gimp::Net)
	- preliminary GTile support (NOT Gimp::Net)
	- preliminary GPixelRgn support (NOT Gimp::Net)
	- preliminary PDL support (in Gimp::PDL)
	- bugfixes

0.91  Fri May 22 01:55:30 CEST 1998
	- Gimp::ColorSelectButton is no longer installed, Gtk-0.2.2 is
	  required.
	- commandlien parameters supported
	- gimp_image_get_layers, gimp_image_get_cmap, gimp_image_get_channels
	  commented out, use pdb functions instead
	- fixed a bug in Fu handling of <Image> plug-ins

0.90  Tue May 12 15:26:50 CEST 1998
	- BUGFIX ONLY RELEASE
	- tracing works in Perl-Server (Oleg Bartunov)
	- fixes for Gtk-0.2.1
	- Gtk::ColorSelectButton renamed to Gimp::ColorSelectButton
	  until Gtk is fixed.
	- _I_ made the error of writing udp when I meant unix. _ARGH_

0.89  Mon May 11 03:29:30 CEST 1998
	- added common commandline options (--help, --host, --verbose)
	- help option for Gimp::Fu
	- added a whole bunch of --with-*= switches
	- well.... still more bugfixes!
	- Gimp::Net will autostart gimp

0.88  Wed May  6 17:00:57 CEST 1998
	- fixed "script-fu-whatever-garbage"->(arguments...)
	- renamed Net-Server to Perl-Server (why?)
	- more (untested) configuration changes. Does it work at all now?
	- removed Gimp::Util (it _was_ not convincing)
	- even more fixes
	- Gimp::Fu! including some documentation ;)
	- added Gtk/ColorSelectButton.pm

0.87  Mon Apr 27 15:38:23 CEST 1998
	- mainly a bugfix release, none of the new features work yet!
	- started to code Gimp::Fu for simple dialogs.
	- added more autoflush for old perls *sigh*
	- autoconf'd. not good, but its a start
	- AUTOLOAD is no longer exported, instead, @ISA is used

0.86  Thu Apr  2 19:59:06 CEST 1998
	- missing __STDC__VERSION__ only gives a warning now
	- got rid of alloca
	- added gimp_set_data & gimp_get_data
	- new module Gimp::Data

0.85  Fri Mar 27 17:43:35 CET 1998
	- compatibility autoflush added in Net-Server, better upgrade to 5.004_04
	- better signal handling in Net-Server... why does libgimp need SIGPIPE?
	- add -lglib to the libraries for Lib.xs, to cater for yet more broken systems

0.84  Fri Mar 13 21:23:07 CET 1998
	- calling "new Object" now actually works the second time.

0.83  Tue Feb 24 17:29:34 CET 1998
	- use strict always everywhere.
	- more errors fixed (by compiling under solaris ;), thanks
	  to dov@Orbotech.Co.IL for pointing it out!
	- change to support gnuc, c9x, and old (none) varargs macro syntax
	  could be done much easier, but I like the correct approach

0.82  Mon Feb 16 12:20:42 CET 1998
	- array types implemented... the gimp pdb wasn't thoughtfully
	  designed, or better: not _too_ thoughtfully.
	- network protocl changed (dunno why, not necessarily better..
	  also I was infected by versionitis (but Data::Dumper has the same
	  problem ;)))
	- floats are now displayed as such ;)

0.81  Sun Feb 15 20:57:53 CET 1998
	- tracing now works for networked scripts.
	- tcp supported in the server & client, but not enabled by default.
	- simplified Gimp::OO.pm
	- IO-syntax now support, i.e. new Image(..), which is still a hacky
	  namespace game

0.80  Fri Feb 13 17:15:48 CET 1998
	- version 1.0 is the first one generally usable.. we're getting
	- close!  Gimp::Net and Gimp::Lib are only internal modules, there
	  is not much of a distinction between networked modules and modules
	  using libgimp!
	- Gimp::OO usable over the network.

0.07  Thu Feb 12 06:51:56 CET 1998
	- some bugfixes, and the addition of Gimp::Net and an accompanying
	  server. See example-net.pl for a demo.

0.06  Wed Feb 11 02:42:24 CET 1998
	- the first user sent an example script ;)
	- PARAM_STRING's are now correctly displayed in traces
	- start of Gimp::Util, not very convincing
	- pseudo-oo interface, see Gimp::OO

0.05  Sat Feb  7 23:31:08 CET 1998
	- added set_trace and trace capabilities. helps to track down bugs in
	  pdb calls

0.04  Sat Feb  7 21:43:56 CET 1998
	- gimp_channel_set_color uses a d_color argument, like everybody else
	- libgimp functions will be used instead of pdb calls
	  wherever possible. libgimp functions using different calling
	  conventions than equivalent pdb functions (gimp_layer_copy, etc..)
	  are NOT exported.

0.03  Sat Feb  7 06:15:09 CET 1998
	- even more usable. although only pdb calls are implemented,
	  most gimp functions are available. dealing with tiles
	  directly in perl is probably too slow anyway (ha-ha ;)
	- the example plugin does slightly more now.

0.02  Sat Feb  7 04:18:17 CET 1998
	- first working version

0.01  Fri Feb  6 17:51:56 CET 1998
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.18
