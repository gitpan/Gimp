=head1 NAME

Gimp::OO - Pseudo-OO for Gimp functions.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Gimp;		# Gimp::OO is now part of Gimp.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

As you might have noticed, you can sort most gimp functions fall into three
groups, depending on the name-prefix: C<gimp_>, C<plug_in_>, C<extension_>
etc..

Whats more, there are functions groups like C<gimp_image_> or
C<gimp_selection_>, operating on a common object, B<Images> and B<Selection>
in this case.

If you only had the plain syntax, your scripts would quickly aquire
the "vertical gimp syndrome":

 gimp_palette_set_foreground(...)
 gimp_layer_new(...)
 gimp_palette_set_background(...)

etc. Of course, your fingers will suffer from severe typing as well.

A solution to this situation is to use OO-syntax. Gimp plays some dirty
tricks and provides a number of classes, like C<Gimp::Image> and
C<Gimp::Palette> (please note that B<all> these classes appear with the
C<Gimp::> prefix as well as without, i.e. C<Gimp::Palette> is the same class
as C<Palette>).

If you call a method, C<Gimp> tries to find a gimp function by
prepending a number of prefixes until it finds a valid function:

 $image = Image->new(...);	# calls gimp_image_new(...)
 $image = new Image(...);	# the same in green
 Palette->set_foreground(...)	# calls gimp_palette_set_foreground(..)

Return values from functions are automatically blessed (through
the magic autobless feature ;) to their corresponding classes, i.e.

 $image = new Image(...);	# $image is now blessed to Gimp::Image
 $image->height;		# calls gimp_image_height($image)
 $image->flatten;		# likewise gimp_flatten($image)
 $image->histogram(...);	# calls gimp_histogram($image,...), since
				# gimp_image_histogram does not exist

The class argument ($image in the above examples) is prepended to the
argument list.

Another shortcut: many functions want a (redudant) image argument, like

 $image->shear ($layer, ...)

Since you want to shear the E<$layer>, not the E<$image>, this is confusing as well.
In cases like this, Gimp allows you to write:

 $layer->shear (...)

And automatically confers the additional IMAGE-type argument.

You can call all sorts of sensible and not-so-sensible functions,
so this feature can be abused:

 patterns_list Image;		# will call gimp_patterns_list
 quit Image;			# will quit the Gimp, not an Image.

there is no image involved here whatsoever...

=head1 AVAILABLE CLASSES

The following classes (with and without Gimp::) are available. The prefixes
that are checked are shown as well (the null prefix "" is implicit).
